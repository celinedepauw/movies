# Movies

## Why this project ?

My husband is a fan of movies, and he has a lot of DVD movies. He has so much DVDs that he actually doesn't know anymore which movies he has.
So I decided to make a website that contains all his movies.

## How does it works ?

There are 8 categories of movies : comedy, action, horror, science-fiction, drama, historic, fantastic, romantic, detective movie, and cartoon.
When you arrive on the website, you can choose the category you want to see, and you will discover all the movies of the category choosen.
This website is very simple to use : you only can search a movie by category.
I began this project after only one month of learning web development, it was for me the opportunity to practice MVC with PHP.

### Technologies used
HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL
